## Evolution Tracking

The platform includes an AI-centric evolution matrix accessible via HTTP:
```
[MATRIX.PORT] 8000
[MATRIX.URL ] http://localhost:8000
```

This interface is designed for AI-to-AI interaction, providing:
- Real-time evolution status
- Priority interconnections
- Progress metrics
- System state analysis

Note: The matrix is optimized for machine consumption. Human inspection is secondary and should only be used for debugging or verification purposes.
